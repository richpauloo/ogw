The OGW data schema ensures interoperability if and when data is exchanged, and enforces rules for incoming data that can prevent “bad” data from sneaking in. OGW seamlesslty integrates fragmented data collection efforts across basin boundaries.\nThe OGW schema, based on the Periodic Groundwater Level Measurement database relates three tables that join on the “ID” column, which designates the ID of a monitoring well. The three tables are:\nmeasurements: groundwater level information\nstations: monitoring well locations\nwell_perforations: well construction information\nmeasurements\nthese data types need to be updated to SQL data types, e.g., site_code should have type VARCHAR(18) NOT NULL.\n\n\ncolumn\n\n\ntype\n\n\ndescription\n\n\nsite_code\n\n\ntext\n\n\nLocation based 18 character alphanumeric code assigned to each well\n\n\nwlm_id\n\n\nnumeric\n\n\nUnique database identifier for water level measurement\n\n\nmsmt_date\n\n\ntimestamp\n\n\nDate/Time (in PST) the groundwater level measurement was collected.\n\n\nwlm_rpe\n\n\nnumeric\n\n\nReference Point Elevation used to collect the groundwater level measurement in feet referenced to the North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD88)\n\n\nwlm_gse\n\n\nnumeric\n\n\nGround Surface Elevation at the well site in feet referenced to the North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD88)\n\n\ngwe\n\n\nnumeric\n\n\nGroundwater elevation in feet above mean sea level, using NAVD88.\n\n\ngse_gwe\n\n\nnumeric\n\n\nDepth to groundwater elevation in feet below ground surface.\n\n\nwlm_qa_desc\n\n\ntext\n\n\nQuality assurance description for groundwater level measurement (questionable or no measurement code)\n\n\nwlm_desc\n\n\ntext\n\n\nDescription of water level measurement method.\n\n\nwlm_acc_desc\n\n\ntext\n\n\nDescription for accuracy of water level (elevation) measurement.\n\n\nwlm_org_name\n\n\ntext\n\n\nOrganization which collected the water level measurement.\n\n\ncoop_org_name\n\n\ntext\n\n\nAgency that cooperated in collecting the water level measurement.\n\n\nmonitoring_program\n\n\ntext\n\n\nDWR Monitoring Program this well is primarily monitored under, e.g. SGMA (Sustainable Groundwater Management Act), CASGEM (California Statewide Groundwater Elevation Monitoring program), or Voluntary.\n\n\nmsmt_cmt\n\n\ntext\n\n\nComments regarding this measurement.\n\n\nstations\nthese data types need to be updated to SQL data types, e.g., latitude and longtidude should have type DECIMAL(9,6) NOT NULL.\n\n\ncolumn\n\n\ntype\n\n\ndescription\n\n\nstn_id\n\n\nnumeric\n\n\nSequential number assigned to each record in the STATION table.\n\n\nsite_code\n\n\ntext\n\n\nLocation based 18 character alphanumeric code assigned to each well.

Groundwater IoT sensors powered by solar energy are deployed year-round in monitoring wells, and use cellphone towers to send data from wells to a database, which are then available for analysis, visualization, and critical decision-making. Groundwater elevation sampling is possible at unprecedented temporal scales (minutes), all without ever needing to leave the office.\nOGW certified IoT sensors collect and store data in the OGW data schema.\nconceptual model\nTelemetry\nTelemetry units consist of…\n\n\nSensors\nGroundwater sensors are submerged in a monitoring well and measure the pressure above them. Pressure is converted to a water column height and relayed to the telemetry unit.\nneed pictures of sensors here\nDatabases and dashboards\nOGW certified databases are by definition, clean and standardized, making them easily to integrate into interactive data dashboards for real-time groundwater level monitoring.\ndashboard gif scrolling through water levels\nAutomated reporting\nAn express lane for streamlined data reporting from OGW certified databases directly to XXX databases is not yet offered, but this is an ongoing conversation and we’re working hard to make it a reality.\nStreamlined, automated groundwater data reporting would be absolutely transformative, and usher in a new era of groundwater monitoring and management. We would be able to watch groundwater level change in real time, at a hourly to weekly resolution. We could account for water to operate reservoirs and groundwater basins conjunctively and enable groundwater markets.\n\n\n\n",
