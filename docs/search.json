Certification only takes a few minutes, and is as easy as uploading a sample of your data and downloading a certificate.\n<gif of a online screen capture showing a user dropping data into a Shiny App, obtaining a success message, and downloading the certificate>\nWhy certify?\nOnce your data has been certified you can be assured it is:\n Interoperable between basins Compliant with DWR annual reporting Eligible for forthcoming streamlined reporting to DWR\n\n\n\n",

The OGW data schema ensures interoperability if and when data is exchanged, and enforces rules for incoming data that can prevent “bad” data from sneaking in. OGW seamlesslty integrates fragmented data collection efforts across basin boundaries.\nThe OGW schema, based on the DWR Periodic Groundwater Level Measurement database relates three tables that join on the “ID” column, which designates the ID of a monitoring well. The three tables are:\nmeasurements: groundwater level information\nstations: monitoring well locations\nwell_perforations: well construction information\nmeasurements\n\n\nVariable\n\n\nData Type\n\n\nNullable\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nID\n\n\nTEXT\n\n\nNOT NULL\n\n\nMonitoring well ID\n\n\nTIMESTAMP\n\n\nDATE\n\n\nNOT NULL\n\n\nSample date and time\n\n\nGWL_FT\n\n\nFLOAT8\n\n\nNOT NULL\n\n\nGroundwater elevation in ft AMSL\n\n\nstations\n\n\nVariable\n\n\nData Type\n\n\nNullable\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nID\n\n\nTEXT\n\n\nNOT NULL\n\n\nMonitoring well ID\n\n\nLNG_WGS84\n\n\nDECIMAL(9,6)\n\n\nNOT NULL\n\n\nMonitoring well longitude in WGS84\n\n\nLAT_WGS84\n\n\nDECIMAL(9,6)\n\n\nNOT NULL\n\n\nMonitoring well latitude in WGS84\n\n\nELEV_FT\n\n\nFLOAT8\n\n\nNOT NULL\n\n\nMonitoring well elevation in ft AMSL\n\n\nwell_perforations\n\n\nVariable\n\n\nData Type\n\n\nNullable\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nID\n\n\nTEXT\n\n\nNOT NULL\n\n\nMonitoring well ID\n\n\nTOP_FT\n\n\nFLOAT8\n\n\nNOT NULL\n\n\nTop of perforated interval in ft below land surface\n\n\nBOT_FT\n\n\nFLOAT8\n\n\nNOT NULL\n\n\nBottom of perforated interval in ft below land surface\n\n\nTCD_FT\n\n\nFLOAT8\n\n\nNOT NULL\n\n\nTotal completed depth in ft below land surface\n\n\nGetting started\nThe most up-to-date version of OGW’s data schema can be downloaded from the OGW Github page.
