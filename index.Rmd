# Why OGW?

Every day, groundwater data is collected for monitoring, modeling, and reporting requirements. Groundwater sustainability plan (GSP) development in California has led to fragmented and non-standard representations of these critical data.


**Open Groundwater (OGW)** is a free, [open source data schema](data-schema.html) that enables:

<i class="fas fa-check" style = "color:#50C878"></i> [DWR annual reporting compliance](reporting.html)  
<i class="fas fa-check" style = "color:#50C878"></i> [IoT sensor networks & automated reporting](reporting.html)  

[**OGW Certification**](certification.html) designates a database that adheres to the OGW data schema, and may be verified for a database free of charge.
