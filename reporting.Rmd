# Created with compliance in mind

The OGW data schema is based on XXX's data schema for the [Periodic Groundwater Level Database](https://data.cnra.ca.gov/dataset/periodic-groundwater-level-measurements). The OGW data team coordinates directly with XXX to ensure that the [OGW data schema](data-schema.html) is submission-ready for annual reporting.  

*need to brainstorm how to illustrate this and what else to put here*
